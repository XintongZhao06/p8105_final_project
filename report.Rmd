# **0 Abstract**
A concise summary of project motivation, data, methods, and key findings.



# **1 Motivation**

Short-form platforms such as TikTok and YouTube Shorts generate massive volumes of user interaction data. Understanding patterns that drive **completion rate** (viewer retention) and **trend label** (whether a video becomes trending) provides insight into how videos perform and how creators or platforms might optimize content.

Our project is motivated by two central questions:

- **Which video attributes show statistical associations with completion rate?**  
- **Can trend labels be predicted from metadata using machine learning?**

We aim to distill interpretable insights, not merely build high-accuracy models. Completion rate is influenced by content quality and recommendation algorithms, neither of which is directly measured. Therefore, we expect relatively low explanatory power from traditional statistical models, and the analysis is intended as a descriptive exploration.

(We anticipate that your project will change somewhat over time; these changes and the reasons for them should be documented!)


# **3 Initial Questions and Project Evolution**

The project began with an interest in understanding viewer retention by examining completion rate. Our initial plan included exploratory data analysis, followed by regression modeling and then building a model using machine learning methods to evaluate how to predict completion rates from metadata. Early results showed that completion rate was extremely difficult to predict, even when more flexible machine learning models were applied. This outcome suggested that completion behavior is strongly driven by unobserved factors such as creative quality and recommendation exposure, which are not present in metadata. As a result, completion rate was treated only as a descriptive target, and the focus shifted to exploratory identification of structural associations rather than building predictive models.

These findings also prompted us to adjust the scope of our research. Since metadata did not seem to explain view completion rates well, we began to consider whether other performance metrics were more suitable for prediction. Trend labels emerged as a suitable alternative because they may capture platform-level dynamics and rely less on unobserved content attributes. This consideration led to the second part of the project, which examines the extent to which trend labels can be predicted using machine learning methods. The evolution of these research questions reflects a growing understanding of both the strengths and limits of metadata in explaining short-form video performance.

## **6.1 Topic 1: Exploratory Regression Analysis of Completion Rate**

### **6.1.1 Purpose of the Regression Analysis**

Completion rate serves as a key performance metric for short-form videos, reflecting how fully viewers watch a given video. Although creators often attribute retention to content quality, narrative structure, or emotional engagement, these elements are unobserved in platform metadata. Our modeling objective is therefore not prediction, but descriptive quantification of associations between completion_rate and observable characteristics such as duration, engagement metrics, posting timing, and creator attributes.

Given the inherent limitations of metadata and the complexity of viewer behavior — shaped by recommendation algorithms, scrolling patterns, and individual preferences — we expect the explanatory power of the regression models to be modest. Nonetheless, regression analysis still offers a clear way to assess which metadata features are associated with completion rate and to identify where nonlinear or structural patterns may warrant more flexible models.

### **6.1.2 Linear Regression Models**

We first developed three linear models to examine these associations: (1) a baseline regression including only timing-related features; (2) an engagement-augmented model that incorporates log-transformed interaction metrics; and (3) a full specification that adds creator-level attributes and applies backward stepwise selection to identify a more parsimonious set of predictors. This progression allowed us to evaluate how the explanatory contribution of different variable groups changes as the model becomes more comprehensive. We then extended the analysis to nonlinear GAM models to assess whether more flexible functional forms capture additional structure or improve explanatory performance beyond what linear models can provide.

#### **6.1.2.1 Baseline Linear Regression**

The baseline regression evaluates how timing-related features and basic video attributes relate to completion_rate. The estimated model is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{completion_rate}_i 
&= \beta_0 
+ \beta_1 \,\text{event_season}_i
+ \beta_2 \,\text{is_weekend}_i \\
&\quad + \beta_3 \,\text{duration_sec}_i
+ \beta_4 \,\text{upload_hour}_i
+ \varepsilon_i .
\end{aligned}
$$


<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="regression_images/model1.png" width="100%">
 <p>Table 6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary of baseline linear regression</p>
</div>

Table 6.1 reports the estimated coefficients and summarizes how basic timing and structural attributes relate to completion rate. The intercept reflects the expected completion rate for the reference category, and while not substantively meaningful on its own, it serves as the baseline against which other coefficients are interpreted. Consistent with expectations, video duration emerges as the strongest predictor: the coefficient for `duration_sec` is negative ($\beta_3$ = -0.0009) and highly significant (p-value < 0.05), indicating that longer videos tend to yield lower completion rates, even within the short-form format. Among the seasonal indicators, only the Regular season shows a small positive association (p-value = 0.041 < 0.05). The remaining `event_season` categories, as well as `is_weekend` and `upload_hour`, do not exhibit statistically significant effects, suggesting that broad posting time patterns have limited influence on completion rate in this dataset.

Overall, the baseline model highlights duration as the primary structural correlate of viewer retention, while other timing-related features contribute little explanatory power. This motivates the incorporation of engagement and creator-level variables in subsequent models.

#### 6.1.2.2 Engagement-Augmented Linear Regression

To explore whether audience interaction patterns co-vary with viewer retention, the second model adds log-transformed engagement metrics — likes, comments, shares, and saves — to the baseline specification. These variables allow us to examine the relationship between video engagement signals and completion rates. The augmented model is presented as follows:

<span style="font-size: 95%;">
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{completion_rate}_i 
&= \beta_0 
+ \beta_1 \,*\text{event_season}_i
+ \beta_2 \,*\text{is_weekend}_i
+ \beta_3 \,*\text{duration_sec}_i \\
&\quad + \beta_4 \,*\text{upload_hour}_i + \beta_5 *\log(\text{likes}_i + 1)
+ \beta_6 *\log(\text{comments}_i + 1) \\
&\quad + \beta_7 *\log(\text{shares}_i + 1)
+ \beta_8 *\log(\text{saves}_i + 1)
+ \varepsilon_i .
\end{aligned}
$$
</span>

<div style="text-align: center;"> 
<img src="regression_images/model2.png" width="100%"> 
<p>Table 6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary of engagement-augmented linear regression</p> 
</div>

Table 6.2 presents the augmented model. Duration remains the strongest negative predictor, consistent the baseline finding. Among engagement metrics, `log_likes` and `log_saves` show statistically significant positive associations with `completion_rate` (p < 0.05). This pattern indicates that videos with stronger engagement signals also tend to have higher completion rates, although the association is correlational rather than causal. In contrast, `log_comments` and `log_shares` are not significant, indicating that not all engagement forms are linked to retention. The timing-related predictors (`event_season`, `is_weekend`, and `upload_hour`) continue to show limited explanatory value, reinforcing that temporal posting patterns do not strongly shape viewer retention.

Overall, expanding the model to incorporate interaction measures offers a modest improvement but does not fundamentally change the structure of associations identified earlier.

#### 6.1.2.3 Full Linear Model and Stepwise Selection

To examine whether creator attributes or stylistic choices add explanatory value beyond engagement patterns, the third model introduces creator-level variables such as log_creator_avg, creator_tier, and has_emoji. We define the full model as follows:

<span style="font-size: 95%;">
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{completion_rate}_i
&= \beta_0
+ \beta_1 \,*\text{event_season}_i
+ \beta_2 \,*\text{is_weekend}_i
+ \beta_3 \,*\text{duration_sec}_i
+ \beta_4 \,*\text{upload_hour}_i \\
&\quad + \beta_5 *\log(\text{likes}_i + 1)
+ \beta_6 *\log(\text{comments}_i + 1)
+ \beta_7 *\log(\text{shares}_i + 1)
+ \beta_8 *\log(\text{saves}_i + 1) \\
&\quad + \beta_9 *\log(\text{creator_avg_views}_i + 1)
+ \beta_{10} *\text{creator_tier}_i
+ \beta_{11} *\text{has_emoji}_i
+ \varepsilon_i .
\end{aligned}
$$
</span>

Because the full specification contains numerous correlated predictors, a backward stepwise procedure is applied to identify a more concise subset of variables. The results of final model are presented in Table 6.3.

<div style="text-align: center;"> 
<img src="regression_images/model3.png" width="100%"> 
<p>Table 6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary of stepwise (backward) regression</p> 
</div>


<span style="font-size: 95%;">
$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\text{completion_rate}}_i
&= \ 0.6638
- 0.0007932 \,*\text{duration_sec}_i
+ 0.008618 *\log(\text{likes}_i + 1) \\
&\quad + 0.002520 *\log(\text{saves}_i + 1)
- 0.008323 *\log(\text{creator_avg_views}_i + 1) \\
&\quad + 0.02303\, *\text{has_emoji}_i .
\end{aligned}
$$
</span>

The backward stepwise model finally retains only five predictors — `duration_sec`, `log_likes`, `log_saves`, `log_creator_avg`, and `has_emoji` — indicating that these features are the ones most strongly associated with variation in completion rate. The negative coefficient for `log_creator_avg` is particularly notable. Holding other factors constant, videos from creators with larger average viewership tend to show slightly lower completion rates. This may reflect heterogeneous audience behavior or differences in content style across creator tiers. Meanwhile, `has_emoji` shows a small but statistically significant positive effect, suggesting that visual cues in titles may enhance viewer engagement. Variables removed during stepwise selection, such as the seasonal and posting-time indicators, contributed little once the more informative predictors were included. 

Overall, the stepwise model produces a concise set of variables strongly linked to completion rate. This provides a clear summary of the linear relationships, establishing a useful baseline for further exploration.

#### 6.1.2.4 Comparison of Linear Models

The three linear models show small but incremental improvements in fit as additional predictors are added. As shown in Table 6.4, the baseline model explains only a small share of variation in `completion_rate` (r-squared = 0.0183). Adding engagement variables increases the r-squared to 0.0308, and the stepwise model achieves the highest value at 0.0411.

<div style="text-align: center;"> 
<img src="regression_images/linear_regression_comparison.png" width="80%"> 
<p>Table 6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparison of linear regression models</p> </div>

Despite these incremental differences, all three models ultimately exhibit low r-squared. This is unsurprising in the context of short-form video performance, where much of viewer retention is shaped by factors not captured in metadata - such as creative quality, editing style, narrative pacing, emotional tone, and topic relevance. Completion outcomes are also influenced by platform recommendation systems, which shape exposure patterns in ways not observable in the dataset. Moreover, linear models impose additive and monotonic relationships that may be too restrictive for inherently nonlinear viewing behaviors. Together, these unobserved elements limit the explanatory power of linear models and help clarify why metadata-based regressions account for only a small fraction of the variation in completion rate.

#### 6.1.2.5 Regression Diagnostics

To assess whether the stepwise model satisfies key regression assumptions, we examine the standard set of diagnostic plots. These plots provide insight into linearity, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals, and the influence of individual observations.

<div style="text-align: center;"> 
<img src="regression_images/diagnostic_checks.png" width="100%"> 
<p>Figure 6.x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diagnostic plots for the stepwise linear model</p> 
</div>

The Residuals vs Fitted and Scale–Location plots show slight changes in residual spread across fitted values, indicating mild heteroscedasticity and some non-linearity. The Q–Q plot reveals noticeable deviations in the tails from a normal distribution; however, this is also expected because Q–Q plots become highly sensitive with large sample sizes and can highlight even very small departures from normality. The Residuals vs Leverage plot shows a few moderately high-leverage points, but none appear strongly influential. 

Overall, the linear model remains adequate for exploratory purposes, but the diagnostics indicate that its assumptions are not fully satisfied and the linear specification may not fully capture the underlying patterns in the data. These limitations motivate the use of nonlinear approaches, such as smooth and wiggly GAM, to capture potential nonlinear patterns that the linear specification may not fully capture.

### 6.1.3 Nonlinear Modeling and Model Comparison

Building on the predictors retained from the stepwise linear model, we extend the analysis to nonlinear specifications to assess whether more flexible functional forms can better capture patterns in completion_rate. In particular, we compare a standard linear model with two generalized additive models (GAMs) that allow nonlinear effects of the predictors.

#### 6.1.3.1 Train–Test Split for Nonlinear Models

To evaluate predictive performance while avoiding overfitting, we randomly sampled 5,000 observations from the full dataset and applied the same preprocessing steps used in earlier models. The resulting dataset was then partitioned into an 80% training set and a 20% test set. All nonlinear models were fit on the training data and evaluated on the held-out test data.

#### 6.1.3.2 Model Specifications: Linear vs Smooth vs Wiggly GAM

We estimate three models using the same predictor set identified through stepwise selection:

1. Linear Model — assumes additive, linear effects for all predictors.

2. Smooth GAM — allows predictors such as duration_sec to vary smoothly, capturing gentle nonlinear trends.

3. Wiggly GAM — uses a higher degree of smoothness flexibility, allowing complex and rapidly changing nonlinear shapes.

These models represent a progression from simple to increasingly flexible structures, enabling assessment of whether added nonlinearity improves fit or merely introduces noise.

#### 6.1.3.3 Visual Comparison of three models

To illustrate differences in model behavior, we visualize fitted values against `duration_sec`, because it is a continuous predictor that allows the linear, smooth, and wiggly models to produce interpretable fitted curves. Variables such as `log_likes` or `has_emoji` are either discrete or less suitable for illustrating non-linear patterns.

<div style="text-align: center;"> 
<img src="regression_images/nonlinear_comparison.png" width="100%"> 
<p>Figure 6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual comparison of linear, smooth GAM, and wiggly GAM fits</p> </div>

Across all three models, the downward association between video duration and completion_rate is clearly visible. The Linear Model produces a simple declining line, while the Smooth GAM allows gradual curvature but remains stable and consistent with overall trends. In contrast, the Wiggly GAM shows highly fluctuating and unstable fits, suggesting overfitting to noise rather than capturing meaningful structure.

#### 6.1.3.4 Cross-Validation Performance and Visualization

Although prediction is not the primary goal of our analysis, cross-validated RMSE provides a useful way to compare how differently structured models behave out of sample and whether added flexibility leads to more stable estimates. Rather than interpreting RMSE as a measure of forecasting accuracy, we use it here to assess the extent to which each model captures consistent patterns versus overfitting noise.

<div style="text-align: center;"> 
<img src="regression_images/RMSE_distribution.png" width="100%"> 
<p>Figure 6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RMSE distributions for the linear and GAM models</p> 
</div>

The RMSE distributions show that the Linear Model and Smooth GAM produce similarly low and stable error levels across folds, indicating that their fitted relationships generalize reasonably well to held-out data. In contrast, the Wiggly GAM exhibits both higher RMSE values and substantially greater variability, showing the instability observed in its fitted curve. This pattern reinforces the conclusion that excessive model flexibility primarily captures sampling noise rather than meaningful structure in the relationship between duration and completion rate.

Overall, these results suggest that modest nonlinear flexibility can be informative, but highly wiggly specifications offer little additional insight and reduce model stability. This indicates that simpler models are better suited for summarizing the underlying relationships in the data and align well with the exploratory goals of Topic 1.

### 6.1.4 Conclusion of Regression Findings

The regression analyses collectively provide a structured overview of how metadata features relate to short-form video completion rates. Across all model specifications, video duration consistently emerges as the strongest and most stable correlate of completion rate, exhibiting a negative association in all models. Engagement-related variables such as `log_likes` and `log_saves` also contribute meaningfully once introduced, suggesting that videos that prompt stronger viewer interaction tend to retain audiences slightly better. Creator-level factors, particularly `log_creator_avg`, show weaker and  inverse relationships, indicating that larger creators do not necessarily achieve higher completion rates.

Although adding predictors improves model fit incrementally, the overall explanatory power remains low, with the best linear model achieving an r-squared of approximately 0.041. This reflects the inherent limitation of metadata, as viewer retention is a complex outcome shaped by uncaptured features such as creative quality, narrative structure, editing choices, emotional resonance, and platform dynamics.

Nonlinear modeling further highlights these constraints. The Smooth GAM captures mild curvature but offers only marginal improvements over the linear specification, while the Wiggly GAM overfits and performs poorly out of sample. Therefore, these results show that more flexible functional forms do not substantially enhance predictive accuracy, reinforcing the conclusion that metadata explains only a small portion of completion behavior.

Overall, the regression analysis provides useful descriptive insight into how structural and engagement-related attributes relate to completion rate, but it also underscores the central role of unobserved creative and algorithmic factors. These findings motivate the exploration of richer feature sets or alternative modeling approaches in future work, while also providing a clear baseline for interpreting patterns in video performance.

# **7. Discussion**
(What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?)

## **7.1 Discussion of Completion Rate **

The regression results reveal several clear patterns in the relationship between video features and view completion rates. Among all models, video length consistently has the strongest influence. Longer videos tend to have lower view completion rates, which aligns with expectations for short-video platforms, as viewers prefer quick and easy-to-understand content. Interaction metrics such as likes and saves are also positively correlated with view completion rates, indicating that videos that retain viewers tend to generate more interaction. More Surprisingly, an unexpected finding is that creator-level attributes, including average historical views, have a weak and even negative correlation with view completion rates. This suggests that having a large audience does not guarantee high retention rates, and content features may be more important than creator scale.

Some results align with intuition, particularly the significant impact of duration and interaction metrics. However, the limited impact of creator attributes and posting time variables is unexpected. The consistently low R-squared value across all models also indicate that these predictors explain only a small portion of the variation in view completion rates. Adding more predictors provides limited improvement, further suggesting that metadata only captures some of the potential factors influencing viewer retention, and many important factors are not included in the dataset.

These findings offer several broader insights. View completion rates appear to depend more on video-level quality, such as content design, thematic appeal, than on the creator's identity or posting time. The low R-squared value confirms that most determinants of retention, including creative quality and algorithmic exposure, are not reflected in the existing variables. Furthermore, the non-linear model shows little improvement over the linear model, suggesting that the primary limitation lies in the lack of relevant content-level information rather than the functional form of the model. In conclusion, metadata can reveal some meaningful patterns, but it can only explain a small fraction of audience behavior on short video platforms.



## **7.2 Trend Prediction Insights**
(ZXT)




# **8 Limitations and Future Work**

For Topic 1, a major limitation of regression analysis is that it models all videos data as a single merged dataset without distinguishing between different platforms, languages or content categories. Because short videos vary greatly in purpose, audience, and cultural context, merging all observations introduces significant heterogeneity. This weakens true relationships, makes some predictors insignificant, and masks confounding patterns that may exist in specific subgroups. The large sample size further exacerbates this problem. In addition, the consistently low R-squared values across all models indicate that the current set of metadata variables captures only a small portion of the factors influencing completion rate. This weak model fit may reflect not only the limits of metadata but also the absence of important content-level or behaviour-level variables that are not observable in the dataset. Therefore, in future research, we should not only expand the breadth of observed variables but also use stratified or subgroup analysis to better control the model and obtain more accurate regressions. For example, completion rate can be modeled separately by language or platform to determine whether the observed correlations are consistent across different content types or whether they are masked by confounding effects in the aggregate dataset. This can also help to identify confounding factors specific to each category and more clearly explain differences in completion rates across different video types.
